## Features

### Traffic Light System
- Four main vehicular traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) to regulate vehicle flow.
- Four pedestrian-specific lights to ensure safety for individuals crossing the intersection.
- Traffic lights are designed following the **German Traffic System**.

### Ultrasonic Sensors
- Ultrasonic sensors are positioned centrally to detect vehicle presence and movement.
- These sensors form a square at the intersection of the lanes, enabling **dynamic control of traffic signals**.

### Buzzer System
- A buzzer alerts for traffic violations, such as vehicles crossing during a red light.
- Promotes safety and ensures rule compliance.

### Environmental Monitoring
- A **DHT11 temperature sensor** monitors environmental conditions.
- Offers potential adaptability for extreme weather scenarios.

### Additional Features
- A 220V LED system is used to simulate real-world traffic light conditions.
- Real-time monitoring and decision-making ensure efficient traffic flow.

## Technical Details

- The project is programmed in **VHDL**.
- Implemented using the **Basys 3 FPGA board**, leveraging its GPIOs and digital capabilities.
